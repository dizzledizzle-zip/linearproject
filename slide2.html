<h3> Step 1: Set up 10 cards per player in this formation, set up the discard pile with one card starting face up in the pile, put the other cards face down in a stack for drawing. </h3>

<h3> Step 2: Start basic play, the objective is to have all your cards face up, you cannot look at your cards previosuly to flipping over. You draw a card and based on it you start your play. If you draw a 1 for example you place it in the first slot and flip over the card that is there, you can use that card to flip over another based on it's position.</h3>
<h3> Step 3: Understanding special cards, kings work as a wild so you can put it anywhere but it also has another use, if the king is in the 8 slot for example and you pull an 8 you can take out the king and use it again, this method has no limit. Queens and Jacks cannot be used in anyway and mean the end of the turn. One you have a slot filled with a number, that number is then uselss and causes the end of the turn simular to jacks and queens.</h3>
<h3> Step 4: When someone fully fills up their set the game starts the ending process, everyone gets 1 more turn before they lose and after they end their turn they can flip over their cards and move kings around for a last minute win. <h3>
<h3> Step 5: That was only one round of the long process, starting the next round decreases whoever won by 1 card. So you go from 10 to 9 then 9 to 8 etc.
